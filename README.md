# cannabis-ca-gov-flywheel-integration
* This is a clone of https://github.com/cagov/ca-design-system-gutenberg-blocks 1.1.7+.
* This is in production on https://cannabis.ca.gov instance (monolith/Flywheel).
* The headless clone will continue to use https://github.com/cagov/ca-design-system-gutenberg-blocks and supplemental plugins.

## Changes in progress

* We are restructuring the main plugin and syncing with some other global changes.
* This version of the Gutenberg Blocks plugin was created with patches and prototype code to explore how the California Design System and WordPress Gutenberg blocks might work on CAWeb hosting. 
We have learned a lot since starting about the host, about the CA tech ecosystem, and will be adjusting the main plugin based on feedback from partner teams. 
* We will use cannabis-ca-gov-flywheel-integration until the new work on the main plugin in complete, and replace with updated code when it's ready.
